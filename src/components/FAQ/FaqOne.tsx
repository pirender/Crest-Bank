                                                Log In to Your Account: Access your online banking account using your username and password. If you haven't enrolled in online banking yet, you may need to do so first. Navigate to Profile Settings: Once logged in, look for a menu option or tab labeled "Profile Settings," "Account Settings," or similar. This is typically located in the main menu or navigation bar of your online banking dashboard. Select Personal Information: Within the Profile Settings section, there should be an option to edit your personal information. Click on this option to proceed. Update Your Details: You'll likely see fields where you can edit various personal details such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and any other relevant information. Make the necessary changes. Verify Changes: After updating your information, review it carefully to ensure accuracy. Double-check all fields before proceeding. Save Changes: Once you're satisfied with the updates, look for a "Save Changes" or "Update Information" button. Click on it to save your edits. Confirmation: You may receive a confirmation message indicating that your changes have been successfully saved. Keep an eye out for this confirmation to ensure that your updates were processed correctly. Log Out: For security purposes, it's a good practice to log out of your online banking account after making any changes to your personal information. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access.
